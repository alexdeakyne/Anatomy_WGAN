# Anatomy_WGAN
An implementation of a WGAN on a dataset comprised of pictures of functional Aortic Valves within porcine hearts.
This dataset was obtained using the Atlas of Human Cardiac Anatomy (http://www.vhlab.umn.edu/atlas/). A gallery of syntetic aortic valves produced from the GAN is depicted below. These images were generated after training the wgan for 75,000 epochs.
